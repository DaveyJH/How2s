        <p>Semantically Neutral - Structural Elements</p>
        <h2>Divs</h2>
        <!-- default, a div will not share horizontal space with other elements -->
        <p><div>A div is a block element.  It will fill the width of its container <br>It is possible to change the size of a div with CSS.  A div takes no semantic meaning, it does allow for properties and attributes to be applied to its children.
            </div>

        <div>Note this test is not in a <code class="blue">&lt;p&gt;</code></div>
        <div>Neither is this, yet it appears below.</div>

        <h3>Block Elements</h3>

        <p>Block elements take the entire width of their container/parent by default.  Browsers typically put a space above and below.<br>Their size can be manipulated.</p>

        <h2>Spans</h2>
        <!-- spans are inline so can go directly next to another element -->
        <span>Spans are inline elements and so:</span><span>continue without a break</span></span><br><span>Spans can nest inside each other but must not contain block elements.  They take the role of allowing property and attribute changes to their contained children.</span>

        <h3>Inline Elements</h3>

        <p>Inline elements take the size of their content.  They do not create a line break before or after.<br>It is not possible to change the size of an inline element.</p>
