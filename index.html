        <h1>Welcome to my How2s</h1>
        <p>This set of pages was written to assist myself in the very early (and forver ongoing) stages of learning to code.  The pages are best viewed as rendered webpages and source code simultaneously.</p>
        <p>There are probably a lot of errors throughout but I hope to maintain and update as I continue to learn.  On the contents page, there is a downloadable .zip file containing my first ever coding experience - click the monkey for the file.  It probably flags up on anti-virus software, I don't know enough yet to stop that!  It runs OK on Windows 10 on the 3 laptops I have tried.</p>
        <p>Go to the <a href="contents.html">contents page</a></p>
